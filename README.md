# python-openCV

Tutorial Examples.

1. Feature Extraction

## Installing openCV 2.x with Anaconda
`conda install -c menpo opencv`

See reference: https://anaconda.org/menpo/opencv

## Installing openCV 3.x 
See reference: https://youtu.be/9hb0gYCv3YI

## Notes to myself
Why moved from opencv2 to opencv3: opencv has no drawMatches()

Why moved from opencv3 to opencv2 later: found various issues. See below for some notes and temporary fixes:

1. "Feature Extraction openCV3.ipynb"
2. "Feature Extraction and Homography.ipynb"

I messed up so much that I need to re-install Anaconda.
