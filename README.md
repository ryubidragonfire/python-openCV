# python-openCV

Tutorial Examples.

1. Feature Extraction

## Installing openCV 2.x with Anaconda
`conda install -c menpo opencv`

See reference: https://anaconda.org/menpo/opencv

## Installing openCV 3.x 
See reference: https://youtu.be/9hb0gYCv3YI

## Notes to myself
Why moved from opencv2 to opencv3: opencv has no drawMatches()

Why moved from opencv3 to opencv2 later: found various issues. See below for some notes and temporary fixes:

1. "Feature Extraction openCV3.ipynb"
2. "Feature Extraction and Homography.ipynb"

I messed up so much that I need to re-install Anaconda.

## Install with winpython
1. Download opencv_python-3.1.0-cp34-cp34m-win_amd64.whl from http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#opencv
- python 3.4 opencv 3

2. copy opencv_python-3.1.0-cp34-cp34m-win_amd64.whl to C:\Tools\WinPython-64bit-3.4.4.5Qt5\scripts\

3. pip install opencv_python-3.1.0-cp34-cp34m-win_amd64.whl
